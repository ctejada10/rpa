  \begin{abstract}
    While digital fabrication has come great lengths since its inception
    decades ago, the promise of fabricating custom devices is still
    unfulfilled. Although the literature contains multiple efforts of adding
    interactivity to digitally fabricated objects, the techniques explored are
    often reserved for the more technical savvy, as they generally require
    extra knowledge from the maker. In this paper, we evaluate the current
    state-of-the-art in the fabrication of interactive objects, analyzing their
    inherent shortcomings. Inspired by the literature, we introduce an
    Interactivity Toolkit comprised of mechanisms to add interactivity to
    3D-printed objects, in an maker-friendly way, and present our firsts
    steps in the population of this toolkit in the form of \bh, a system
    that allows the user to acoustically tag 3D-printed objects by embedding
    blowing-activated tags inside them.  We additionally discuss the current
    and future efforts towards enabling interactions in a maker-friendly way
    with the introduction of \at, a system that leverages airflow to
    enable touch interaction in digitally fabricated objects.

  \section{Introduction}    
    Although fabrication technology research may appear to be a recent trend in
    the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and computer graphics communities,
    this technology has been around for decades. The development of these
    technologies took place behind closed doors starting in the 1960s as a
    rapid prototyping technology. The expiration of major patents in 2009
    marked the beginning of the transition of this technology from the industry
    to the hands of the consumers.
    
    The birth of this new category of fabricators (henceforth referred as
    makers) peaked the interest of researchers. Studies
    like~\cite{Shewbridge:2014gl} explore the possible uses of this
    technologies in the hand of everyday makers, concluding in that one of the
    most important tasks undertaken by these makers is one of \emph{augmented
    fabrication}~\cite{Ashbrook:2016fga}: designing and fabricating objects
    that work with already existing ones. 
    
    We believe that the next natural step in the evolution of these
    technologies is enabling its users to fabricate fully interactive objects,
    that in turn can be then used as interfaces to the user's devices. This
    is corroborated by the numerous efforts published in the literature in the
    past years exploring novel ways to add interactivity to digitally
    fabricated objects (see \cref{sec:related-work} for a comprehensive
    literature review).
    
    However, previous work exploring the enabling of interactivity in digitally
    fabricated devices focus their efforts to the interactivity mechanisms
    themselves, without taking into consideration how the inclusion of these
    mechanisms adds more complexity to the fabrication process. The inclusion of
    electronic techniques, and advanced fabrication processes adds another
    level of complexity to the already complicated fabrication
    process~\cite{Hudson:2016hi, Mellis:2012ba, Weichel:2014ed} and can hinder
    the acceptance of these new technologies by novice users.
    
    %ToDo: Add more examples of naturally occurring phenomenons
    Inspired by these limitations, in this paper we propose to enable
    interactions in digitally fabricated objects by utilizing naturally
    occurring properties (e.g. acoustic resonance, fluid dynamics). Rather than sensing
    the interactions of the user on the object itself, we propose to indirectly
    sense them by measuring the changes caused by the interaction to these
    properties using wearable sensing technologies. By externally sensing the
    effects the user's interactions have in these properties, the objects
    augmented with our mechanisms can be interacted with immediately after they
    finish printing, and do not require the addition of circuitry enable
    interactions.

  \section{Research Questions}
    Based on the discussion presented above, we seek to answer the following
    research questions through our work:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What different natural properties can be leveraged to enable
        interactivity to digitally fabricated objects?
      \item How many different interaction mechanisms can we enable by making
        use of these properties?
      \item How does these interaction mechanisms perform against more complex
        mechanisms?
    \end{enumerate}
    
  \section{Related Work}
    \label{sec:related-work}
    Adding interactivity to 3D-printed objects has been a popular topic in the
    literature in recent years. While most efforts explore novel and
    interesting ways to make 3D printed objects more interactive, few
    concentrate their efforts in adding these interactive capabilities in an
    maker-friendly way---reserving this process for experienced and
    knowledgeable makers. Below we present a comprehensive survey of the
    different methods used to enable interactivity explored by the
    literature, categorized by the mechanisms used to enable them.

    \subsection{Acoustic}
      We can find in the literature multiple efforts leveraging acoustic
      properties to enable interactivity in printed objects.
      Stane~\cite{MurraySmith:2008ch}, for example, uses different surface
      textures that produce distinct acoustic signatures when rubbed with a
      finger. The sounds generated by these interactions are then captured by a
      microphone under the surface of the object and further analyzed and classified.

      Conversely, an effort similar to Stane is Lamello~\cite{Savage:2015cs}.
      Here, the authors leverage a series of components that, when interacted
      with, produce singular acoustic fingerprints by strumming fabricated
      comb-like structures that generates an identifiable signature. These
      tones are captured by contact microphones placed under the surface of the
      object, and identified using a classification pipeline. Notably, in this
      effort, the authors compiled a library of different interaction
      techniques that can be enabled using this mechanism, comprised of
      different types of buttons, sliders and dials.

      Continuing, efforts like Acoustruments~\cite{Laput:2015hn} enable more
      elaborate interactions by leveraging more elaborate fabrication
      processes. Here, the authors create acoustic pathways to route the audio
      emitted from a smartphone's speaker to its microphone, making use of
      physical controls to modify the signal going through this path. These
      controls can enable an abundance of interactions, from tilt to pressure
      sensing, and can be leveraged to create numerous application, as the
      paper presents.

      Although these efforts enable an abundance of interesting interaction
      possibilities, they do it at the expense of complex fabrication
      techniques. While digital fabrication technologies are becoming
      ubiquitous, most novice makers are not experienced in complex fabrication
      techniques, limiting the reach of the interactions presented above.

    \subsection{Electric}
      Using electronic components to add interactivity to objects has been
      thoroughly used in manufacturing processes for decades. Thanks to advances
      in commercially available printers, makers can use a combination of
      conductive and nonconductive materials to enable new interaction
      modalities to their objects.

      An example of the efforts carried out leveraging electronic mechanisms to
      enable interactions is Steel-Sense~\cite{Vasilevitsky:2016hy}. In this
      effort, the authors leverage dielectric materials between two surfaces to
      create a hinge between two conductive surfaces, effectively sensing the
      angle of rotation of said surfaces.

      Continuing, in Liquido~\cite{Schmitz:2016cv}, the authors leverage capacitive
      sensing and dielectric liquids (such as water) to augment the printed
      object with tilt and motion sensing. Using a dual extrusion printing
      process, the authors add conductive filament to the walls of a cavity,
      where the fluid is to be poured into. This cavity is then closed, and,
      when the liquid comes in contact with a sensor, capacitance increases.
      These changes in the position of the liquid inside the object can be then
      translated to movement and orientation.

      Adding, the authors of PyzoFlex~\cite{Rendl:2012er} created a
      proprietary, printable, ferroelectric material, that, relying on the
      piezoelectric effect~\cite{Cady:1964fh}, can be used to add touch, pressure and
      bend sensing capabilities to 2D surfaces. This material also has
      pyroelectric characteristics, allowing it to sense changes in temperature
      in the printed object.

      Even though these new interaction capabilities enabled by the
      aforementioned efforts can unlock a wide variety of applications, they
      all require the user to possess certain electronic knowledge to fabricate
      these augmented objects. Not every maker has an electronic background,
      therefore these mechanisms are limited to a selected few.

    \subsection{Optic}
      Other researchers have explored enhancing printed objects using optical
      mechanisms. Notable efforts include Printed Optics~\cite{Willis:2012bc} by Willis \etal,
      where the authors are able to sense user input my using light pipes
      and custom optical sensors. In this paper, the authors present
      different examples of augmented objects using this technology, like
      sliders, touch pads, and buttons.

      Another interesting effort is Sauron~\cite{Savage:2013kua}, where the
      authors make use of a camera, with an accompanying light ring, embedded
      to the inside of the printed object to detect the movements of
      areas of interest. This setup is augmented using a
      system of mirrors to allow the camera to  ``see'' around corners and
      bocks inside the object. This mechanism enabled a variety of interaction
      methods, like buttons, sliders, scroll wheels, etc.
      
      While both of the aforementioned efforts make use of optic mechanisms to
      enable very different interactions, they do so by increasing the
      complexity of the fabrication pipeline. In~\cite{Savage:2013kua} the
      maker is required to assemble the interactive components on the printed
      shell, as well as cameras and mirrors to sense the interactions, while
      in~\cite{Willis:2012bc} requires the use of intricate and expensive
      fabrication equipment and materials.

    \subsection{Metamaterial}
      3D-printing technologies enable the production of new types of
      metamaterials, since the properties of the material can be outlined
      throughout different sections of an object. By modifying the
      microstructures that compose the object, the maker can influence
      properties like strength, weight and flexibility, enabling different ways
      to interact with the fabricated object.
      
      Ion \etal explore these concepts in their work titled Metamaterial
      Mechanisms~\cite{Ion:2016kx}. Here, the authors employ different
      metamaterial structures to create mechanical interfaces in digitally
      fabricated objects. In their work, the authors introduce what they refer
      as \emph{cells}, that allow deformation in one direction, but not on
      other. The authors then use these metamaterials to fabricate common
      mechanical interfaces like a door knob, a pair of pliers, among others.
      
      This work was then extended in Digital Mechanical
      Metamaterials~\cite{Ion:2017bo}. Here, making use of bi-stable
      mechanisms, the authors add logic to their designs. The authors were able
      to augment their previous designs with logical gates and switches.

      Even though these presented efforts are truly pushing the boundaries of
      what is considered a 3D-printed object, they rely on very complicated
      printing techniques to enable said interactions. As we mention
      beforehand, most novice makers are not well versed in such complicated
      techniques, and such should not be required to add interactivity to
      objects.

  \section{Research Plan}
    Although the literature presents a wide variety of mechanisms to add
    interactivity to 3D-printed objects, the big majority of these rely on some
    form of extra knowledge from the maker, either as a background in
    electronics, or complex printing techniques. These
    aforementioned techniques and mechanisms are in fact adding more complexity
    to an already complex process~\cite{Hudson:2016hi, Mellis:2012ba,
    Weichel:2014ed}., in turn raising higher the barrier for users to fabricate
    their own interactive devices.

  \section{Interactivity Toolkit}
    Inspired by the limitations in the literature mentioned above, we propose
    an Interactivity Toolkit where the maker can augment its three-dimensional
    models by leveraging naturally occurring properties, and wearable computational capabilities and sensing.
    
    The different mechanisms that will constitute this interaction toolkit must
    possess the following common qualities. They must be able to be printed in
    commodity printers, thus guaranteeing that these mechanisms are able to be
    fabricated using all kinds of printers. Additionally, these mechanisms must
    be ready to use right off the printer, requiring no post-print assembly or
    cleaning, ensuring that even the most novice of users can augment their
    objects using them. Lastly, while the objects must be modified to enable
    interactions, these modifications must be minimal, preserving the objects
    form.
    
    \subsubsection{\bh}
      We have already taken steps in populating this interactivity toolkit. The
      first addition to it is \bh~\cite{Tejada:2018fj}. \bh enables
      users to tag sections of 3D-printed objects by embedding blowing-activated
      tags inside them. In this section, we present and describe how \bh works.

      \textbf{Overview}\\        
        \bh is based on the principle of acoustic resonance: the same
        principle that makes a bottle whistle when blown across its mouth.
        \bh embeds cavities into 3D models with tubular openings to the
        surface. The variations in the volume of said cavities and lengths of
        the tubes produce changes in the fundamental frequency of the sound
        generated when these cavities are gently blown on. This sound is then
        identified by our system, effectively linking the produced sound to a
        location on the model. Using our design tool, a user can select an
        arbitrary location on a 3D model to embed openings on; associating
        actions to each location. After optimizing the cavity sizes, the
        software provides a printer-ready file for fabrication.
        
        The cavities used in \bh must possess certain qualities: they must
        allow enough variation in their parameters to generate a wide enough
        range of frequencies when blown into; their size must be small enough
        to be embedded into handheld objects; and they should be printable in
        any orientation. After experimenting with numerous cavity shapes
        (spheres, tubes, cubes, pyramids, cylinders, and their 
        combinations), the geometry that resulted in the best combination of
        clear sound and multi-orientation printability was a sphere with a tube
        connecting to the surface of the model.
        
        Leveraging the principle of acoustic resonance, where particular
        frequencies are amplified or attenuated due to the physical properties
        of a cavity, we embed spherical cavities inside a 3D-printed model with
        straight pipes openings onto the surface. The resulting frequency is
        tied to the area, and length, of the opening to the surface and the
        volume of the embedded cavity. This is commonly modeled using the
        Helmholtz~\cite{Helmholtz:1885vp} resonance equation:
        
        \begin{align}\label{eq:hhz}
          f = \frac{cd_t}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{3}{8(L_t+.75 d_t)d_s^3}}
        \end{align}
        where $c$ represents the speed of sound, $d_s$ the diameter of the
        cavity, and $d_t$ and $L_t$ the diameter and length, respectively, of
        the tube connecting the cavity to the surface of the model.
        \cref{fig:resonator} provides an illustration of these parameters in a
        \bh cavity.
        
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
            \includegraphics[height=1.25in]{figures/helmholtz_illustration}
            \quad
            \includegraphics[height=1.25in]{figures/cavities2}
            \caption{Left: an ideal spherical \hhz resonator, with tube diameter
            $d_t$, tube length $L_t$, and sphere diameter $d_s$. Right:
            cross-sections of two \bh test objects, showing the resonator
            structures.}
            \label{fig:resonator}
        \end{figure}
                            
            To better understand the limitations of the frequencies we could
            detect and differentiate between, we took an experimental approach
            by printing 48 objects enclosing different sized cavities between
            them (a subset of these objects is presented in
            \cref{fig:cylinders}).  These objects were replicated in multiple
            FDM\footnote{Fused Deposition Modeling---the most-common consumer
            printer technology} printers (Qidi Technology X-One, LulzBot Taz 4,
            and LulzBot Taz Mini) to compare the differences in the resulting
            frequency, if any. We then asked 10 people to blow on each
            cylinder, while we recorded the data using a laptop computers'
            built-in microphone.  \cref{fig:spectrogram} presents spectrograms
            from one for a series of blows into different cavity
            configurations.
        
        \textbf{Implementation}\\
          \bh is comprised of three main parts: a design software to modify
          existing 3D models; the objects augmented with resonant cavities; and
          a software that recognizes the sound caused by the user blowing into
          an augmented object, triggering the corresponding action.
          
          \textit{Design Software}\\
            Our software is built on top of Autodesk Meshmixer, making use of
            its Python API to remote control the suite, and execute commands.
            After the user has tagged all the desired positions in the model,
            and linked them to their corresponding action, we find a set of
            $L_t$ and $d_s$ that can fit in the requested locations without
            cavities colliding, using a depth-first search algorithm with
            backtracking.
            
          \textit{\bh-enabled Objects}\\
            Because our system embeds resonant cavities in existing models, the
            printability of said model is not affected. Thanks to the
            capabilities of most hobbyist 3D-printers to print up to a 45°
            overhang without the need of support material, embedding \bh
            cavities does not cause any extra cleanup on the augmented object
            (aside from removing some ``3D-printer spaghetti'', some of it can
            be seen in \cref{fig:resonator}). The little to none cleanup and
            the complete lack of assembly required to interact with a
            \bh-enabled object means that the maker can interact with his
            fabricated object directly off the printer.
            
            \bh-enabled objects can be used for a different number of
            applications. In our paper we present six different uses for
            \bh-enabled objects that illustrates the potential for \bh, from
            those, we present three:
            
              \underline{Music Controller.} We built a ``music box'' comprised
              of raised controls, each augmented with a \bh cavity inside,
              capable of controlling the music playback by blowing. \bh is
              robust enough to background noise that its performance was not
              affected by music playing in the background.
              
              \underline{Cell Model.} We augmented a model of an animal
              cell\footnote{\url{http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:689381}} by
              adding \bh tags to different parts of the cell. When the user
              acts on the tags, \bh launches the accompanying Wikipedia cell
              for the corresponding cell component.
              
              \underline{Interactive Animals.} We fabricated three different
              cetaceous: a
              dolphin\footnote{\url{http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1121803}},
              and two
              whales\footnote{\url{http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:232247}\\
              \url{http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:665571}}, and set the
              position of the cavity to the animal's blowhole. When these
              objects are interacted with, a corresponding video is played on
              the user's computer.
            
            \begin{figure}
              \centering
              \includegraphics[width=.95\columnwidth]{figures/cylinders.jpg}
              \caption{A subset of our test cylinders with varying cavity
                volumes and tube lengths.}
              \label{fig:cylinders}
            \end{figure}
            
          \textit{Blow Sound Recognition}\\
            While exploring new wearable interactions in
            Bitey~\cite{Ashbrook:2016ek}, we learned very useful concepts on
            acoustic signal processing and machine learning. We employ these
            concepts in the recognition of the sounds produced when the user
            blows into the \bh cavities. We window the 44.1 KHz signal in 0.1
            second, non-overlapping segments. After computing the RMS value for
            each segment, we look for 0.5 seconds of contiguous windows that
            exceed an empirically set threshold, representing the presence of
            sound. Using Welch's method~\cite{Welch:1967jw}, we extract the
            power spectrum of the signal and use the strongest frequency as the
            resonant frequency of the sound. We then match this frequency to
            the frequencies generated by the set of cavities configurations
            ($d_s$ and $L_t$) to determine which hole the user is interacting
            with. Once classified, we execute the associated action present in
            the configuration file created by the design software.
                       
            The robustness of this algorithm was evaluated against the data
            gathered from our participants, obtaining a 98\% average accuracy
            (please refer to the paper for a complete discussion of these
            results).

            \caption{Waveform (top) and spectrogram (bottom) of blows into
            holes with a tube length $L_t$ of 2.5~mm, with the cavity diameter
            $d_s$ varying in steps of 2~mm from 4~mm on the left to 18~mm on
            the right.}
            \label{fig:spectrogram}
        \end{figure*}

      \textbf{Future Work}\\        
        We believe that some of the main strengths of \bh is its
        playfulness and its capabilities to translate a physical location on an object to an
        acoustic signature. Therefore, we are interested in exploring how
        \bh is used by children and sight impaired users in a controlled
        user study. This study will help assess the experience of these two
        populations while using \bh.
        
    \subsection{New Interaction Mechanisms}
      We continue to explore the different mechanisms we can utilize to enable
      interactivity in 3D-printed models in an maker-friendly way. As we did
      with \bh, we aim to leverage naturally occurring properties to
      enable interactivity in fabricated objects. In this section we will
      present our current, and future, efforts in adding interactivity to 3D-printed models.
      
      \subsubsection{\at}
        For the next addition to our interactivity toolkit, we draw inspiration
        from \bh, as we continue to leverage sound generated by air
        currents to enable interactivity in 3D-printed objects. We focus our
        efforts, this time, to augment the fabricated objects by adding touch
        interactivity. As all future additions to our toolkit, \at must
        satisfy the aforementioned qualities to guarantee
        maker-friendliness.

        To enable touch interactivity in 3D-printed objects, we will make use
        of Bernoulli's principle for fluid dynamics~\cite{Bernoulli:1738ut} to
        design a system of pipes with openings to the surface, which will be
        embedded inside the fabricated object. When connected to an air source
        (e.g. air compressor), this structure will route the airflow
        through the object to the different places of interest identified by
        the maker. These ducts will be configured in a way that they afford air
        to flow to these openings, but when the opening is covered (e.g. by a
        finger) the air corresponding to that opening is then rerouted through
        an exhaust pipe. Each corresponding exhaust pipe will be corrugated
        with a unique pattern that translates the flow of air into predictable,
        identifiable, sounds. \cref{fig:elephant-airtouch} presents a
        simplified model of how these air ducts will look inside a 3D-printed
        elephant, where the airflow begins in the elephant's trunk and is then
        propagated using previously described structure.
        
        These structures can enable a variety of touch interactions on the
        3D-printed object, ranging from simple touch interactions, to more
        complex gestures like sliding and long-presses. We will enable these
        interactions by analyzing the duration of the already
        identified signal.
                
        Similarly to \bh, \at will be made up of three main components: a
        design system that allows users to modify existing three dimensional
        models, the \at-enabled objects, and a wearable-based recognition
        software that identifies the emitted sound, triggering the
        corresponding action.
        
        Once we finish developing \at, our next step will be to evaluate the
        usability of our system. To do so, we will recruit up to 15 novice
        makers from the local makerspace and carry out a user study. In the
        study, we will observe how the participants use \at to augment existing
        designs with touch interactivity, noting all their comments throughout
        the process.
        
  \section{Conclusion}
    In this paper we presented and analyzed the obstacles that plague the
    current state-of-the-art in the fabrication of interactive objects. In
    response to said limitations, we introduce  our effort to lower the
    complexity on adding interactivity to fabricated objects by leveraging
    natural properties. Our solution takes the form of an Interactivity Toolkit
    where the maker can choose which mechanisms to augment its object with. As
    a first addition to this toolkit, we introduced Blowhole, a system that
    allows the maker to tag its three dimensional models using
    blowing-activated tags. Additionally, we present our current efforts in
    populating our Interactivity Toolkit with \at. Here, we will embed a system
    of air ducts inside a three dimensional model to leverage touch
    interactions and enable a variety of gestures.

  \section{Appendix}
    This work was performed in the Future Everyday Technology Research
    Laboratory (FETLab) under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Ashbrook, the
    director of this space. The FETLab focuses its work in the democratization
    of digital fabrication technologies (e.g. 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC
    milling). The premise behind their work is that, although digital
    fabrication equipment are now reasonably priced to be afforded by
    enthusiasts and hobbyists, the tools and process accompanying these still
    present high levels of difficulty which not all novices can reach. The work
    presented on \bh was carried out by the Acoustic Interfaces group comprised
    of Zhiyuan Li, Osamu Fujimoto, and myself, where Zhiyuan was responsible
    for the implementation of the design software, Osamu focused on
    experimenting with the different cavity shapes and sizes, and I was
    responsible of the development of the sound recognition section.
